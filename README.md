## Installation

To set up the environment, install the required dependencies

## Usage

Each project folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) for data processing, training models, and evaluating performance. To run a notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the desired notebook from the file tree.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this repository are publicly available and are stored in the respective project folders under `/data` or `/resources`.

## Models

Pre-trained models and weights are available under the `/resources` directory inside each project folder. Example model files include:

- `*.h5` for trained deep learning models

- `scaler.pkl` for pre-fitted scalers
